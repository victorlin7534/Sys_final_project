Statement: This project emulates the functionality of coding bat in which the user writes code in accordance with the prompt. The user is then notified whether or not he/she met the requirements.

Usage: The program uses a GUI to send and receive information to and from the user. It also serves a text editor for the coding section of the game.


Design:
Files: coding prompts and their solutions will be stored in files
Semaphores: limiting the number of user that can run the game at once (5?)
Processes: forking to compile and run code from different users simultaneously
Pipes/sockets: user to server/network communication
Signals: signal handling for exiting program


Timeline:
	12/28 Project proposal
	(time of confirmation) create basic framework: client to server/network communication
