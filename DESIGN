Statement: This project emulates the functionality of coding bat in which the user writes code in accordance with the prompt. 
The user is then notified whether or not he/she has met the requirements. If possible, we will try to expand it to multiplayer
where multiple people could compete on the problem.

Usage: The program uses a GUI to send and receive information to and from the user. There will be text box where the user will 
type in the code, a button to submit the code, a display showing the number of problems the user has completed successfully and 
a display for the prompt. When the user submits his/her code, there will be a pop-up notifying the user of his/her success/failure. 


Design:
Files: coding prompts and their solutions will be stored in files
Semaphores: limiting the number of user that can run the game at once (5?)
Processes: forking to compile and run code from different users simultaneously
Pipes/sockets: user to server/network communication
Signals: signal handling for exiting program
Arrays will be used, and code submissions will be run/checked in queue-like fashion

Work Distribution: Whomever is capable of doing something whenever will complete a part of the project as he sees fit.


Timeline:
	(time of confirmation) create basic framework: client to server/network communication
	(~5 or 7 days) complete all underlying user input functionalities & prompts/solutions
	(~5 or 7 days) extend functionalities to GUI
